<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Emmet is great for that. With it installed in the code editor you are using, <br>
    you can type “lorem” and then tab and it will expand into a paragraph of Lorem <br>
    Ipsum placeholder text. But it can do more! You can control how much you get, <br>
    place it within HTML structure as it expands, and get different bits of it in repeated elements.
